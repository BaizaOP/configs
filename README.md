# configs
This is a repositiory containing all of my configuration files!

## Notes:
- Both my _vimrc (that's the notation for the .vimrc on windows) and my init.vim require the Vim Plug plugin manager to work. 
- Also, my _vimrc requires the color files for the Jellybean color scheme found here https://github.com/nanotech/jellybeans.vim
- If you want to use my alacritty.yml on Linux/macOS, just comment out, or delete, the "shell: cmd.exe" line. I used that to change the default windows editor from powershell to cmd.
